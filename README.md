### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery is a javascript library that consists of prewritten javascript code that may be utilized to preform javascript functions (such as animating a page or page elements) without having to write extensive amounts of javascript code.  In order to use jQuery on your page, you must include a reference link so that the page may access the library in order to understand what each function means.
2. When defining an event in javascript or jQuery, it is important that you assign a listener to the event.  Most commonly, the listener will be a click, meanning that when the user clicks a specified element on the page, the javascript code is executed.  The listener does not have to be a click, however, and may be many different things, including keyboard imput or movement of the mouse.  Normally, a jQuery function will be written inside of a document.ready function in order to ensure the jQuery function does not execte before the web page is fully loaded.
3. It is not always in a programmer's best interest to point to the latest version of a javascript library.  If the programmer does choose to point to the latest version of jQuery, they run the risk that certain functions that worked in previous versions will not work, and that the code may not have been adequately tested for errors or bugs.
